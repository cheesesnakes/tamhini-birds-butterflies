Jungle Crow,Omnivore,Corvus macrorhynchos,"Omnivorous scavenger. Takes carrion of all kinds, by foraging along shorelines and roadsides, stealing food items from vulture nests (food brought in by parent vultures to feed their young). Robs bird nests of both eggs and fledglings, feeds with vultures on animal carcasses, kills rodents and palm-squirrels (Funambulus), lizards (Colotes), frogs, large invertebrates including crabs, centipedes (Chilopoda), grasshoppers and locusts (Orthoptera), moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), ants (Formicidae) and termites (Isoptera); clumsily hawks for winged termites and even small bats in flight. Also takes variety of fruit, both wild and cultivated, including berries and cherries; variety of cereals (e.g. Sorghum, Oryza, Pennisetum, Triticum, Zea), seen to wrench off whole maize cobs and digs up groundnuts (Arachis). Clumsily feeds among foliage of a variety of flowering trees (e.g. Bombax, Erythrina, Butea, Grevillea, Spathodea), taking both nectar and petals. In Japan, a bird feeding young was seen to hide food items during early-morning foraging, returning later to feed both young and sitting partner on nest. In N India one was watched as it hammered a concealed object, possibly a nut or a pine cone, with a stone. Usually encountered in pairs or family parties, often feeding with other birds in fruiting trees; larger congregations at good food sources. In Himalayas, follows herds of goats and sheep high into their summer pastures."
Black Drongo,Insectivore,Dicrurus macrocercus,"Food predominantly insects  (often agricultural pests), including locusts, grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), bugs (Hemiptera), termites (Isoptera), ants and bees (Hymenoptera), even ferocious rock bees (Apis dorsata), also moths, butterflies and larvae (Lepidopera), damselflies (Zygoptera); occasionally, mainly on Indian Subcontinent, diet reported as much more varied, including lizards, small bats, and nestlings and small birds such as flycatchers (Muscicapa), prinias (Prinia), white-eyes (Zosterops), ioras (Aegithina), swallows (Hirundinidae); cattle ticks (Ixodoidea), considered an important food resource in Sri Lanka. Reported as feeding on dead fish floating on muddy water, frequently flying to perch on nearby tree, carrying a fish c. 10 cm long in bill. Also seeks nectar (from Bombax ceiba, B. insigne, Butea monosperma, Erythrina), during which forehead and throat feathers become covered with pollen (thus helps in cross-fertilization of plants). In Gujarat (India) one individual reported as feeding on sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) grains; took 30 grains in ten minutes by pecking repeatedly under its feet while perched on top of the ear. Regularly reported as pirating worms (Annelida) or other prey from Eurasian Hoopoes (Upupa epops), mynas or wagtails (Motacilla). Spends middle of day calmly on shady trees. Forages mainly in morning and evening hours, hunting insects attracted by electric lights as late as 2–4 hours after sunset. Perches on wires, fence posts, posts, bare treetops, earth banks or other vantage, sallying to catch prey on the wing, to seize it among herbage, or to snatch termites and other insects emerging from ground. During human activity in rice fields, perches close by on elevated posts and pounces on insects disturbed or exposed by the plough; feeds also on ground, swooping down on prey and either eating it immediately or carrying it in bill to perch. Tears larger items to pieces before swallowing them; removes wings of damselflies and other large-winged insects before consumption. Usually solitary, but will gather in numbers to feed on swarming winged termites or emerging mosquitoes (Culicidae); attracted to forest fires and areas of burning grass, where it captures escaping insects, even amid thick rising smoke. Also joins parties of Yellow-billed Babbler (Turdoides affinis) or Jungle Babbler (Turdoides striata), hawking insects flushed by the babblers, the latter (not competing for food, as near-ground foragers) benefit­ing from protection afforded by drongo against predators; same behaviour and benefit observed in associations with ground-feeding flocks of Jungle Myna (Acridotheres fuscus) and/or Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis). Foraging trips of present species considerably more successful when with medium-sized and large myna flocks. Associates also with mammals, mainly cattle  , water buffalo or goats, catching insects disturbed by them; often uses back of cattle as mobile perch. Outside breeding season, roosts in trees or bamboo groves, dispersing at dawn to feeding areas; hardly enters closed tree cover during daytime, often foraging far from any trees."
Baya Weaver Bird,Grainivore,Ploceus philippinus,"Diet seeds, including those of Phalaris minor, Echinochloa colonum, Pennisetum typhoideum, cultivated rice (Oryza), wheat (Triticum), maize (Zea mays), sorghum, millet and sunflowers (Helianthus); also nectar of Bombax, Erythrina and Capparis. Also animal food, insects mainly grasshoppers (Orthoptera), with flies (Diptera), termites (Isoptera), beetles (Coleo­ptera), caterpillars (Lepidoptera) and butterflies (of family Nymphalidae); also spiders (Araneae), small snails (Gastropoda); rice frogs (Rana limnocharis) in S India (Kerala) caught in paddyfield, battered on perch and then eaten piecemeal. Gecko (Gekkonidae) and changeable lizard (Calotes versicolor) fed to nestlings. Adults primarily granivorous, with rice often the most important food item; in trials with captives, Echinochloa colonum the preferred seed type. Nestling diet included 16% plant material. Gregarious. Daytime roosts near feeding grounds occupied during hottest period of day; communal roosts occupied throughout year, often in association with other species, e.g. P. benghalensis and P. manyar, starlings (Sturnidae), waxbills (Estrildidae), sparrows (Passeridae), wagtails (Motacillidae) and bulbuls (Pycnonotidae)."
Pied Kingfisher,Carnivore,Ceryle rudis,"Largely fish  in Africa, including Engraulicypris argenteus, Haplochromis, Barbus and Clarius at L Victoria; Haplochromis, other cichlids, Barbus paludinosus in Botswana; in South Africa, Ambassis natalensis, Gilchristella aestuarius and many other species in Kosi Estuary, and also Sarotherodon mossambicus at L St Lucia; Barbus, Alestes and cichlid species in Zambia, and cichlids Cyrtocara eucinostomus and Pseudotropheus zebra in Malawi. Preferred size range of fish 25–60 mm, but those up to 133 mm and 26 g are taken. Aquatic insects may supplement this, and dragonfly nymphs (Anisoptera) were 24% of all prey items on Kafue Flats, in Zambia; also winged insects, e.g. adult dragonflies, alate termites (Macrotermes); and grasshoppers (Ruspolia flavovirens), water beetles (Dytiscidae, Gyrinidae), water scorpions (Nepidae), water-bugs (Notonectidae, Corixidae, Belostomatidae); 2 birds flushed from a carcass in Tanzania were probably feeding on maggots. In the Sundarbans of India, fish included Mugil parsa, Ambassis, Puntius and Mystus, with crabs and crayfish (17% of prey) and aquatic insects (26%) also taken. Frogs, tadpoles and molluscs also recorded, though latter may be secondarily ingested. Average daily food intake estimated to be 18·4 g (24·6% of body weight), representing 7·2 fish/bird/day; 2 hand-reared juveniles near to fledging also had daily intake of 24–26% of body weight, but younger captive nestlings ate 34·5 g/day (45% of body weight). Pellets consisting of undigested bones and insect sclerites are produced at night and during resting periods during day, prior to resuming foraging. Hunts by scanning from perch  , bobbing head and flicking tail, and then diving down, hitting water with a splash, returning  with prey carried crosswise in its bill. Small fish may be swallowed in flight; larger ones (over 55 mm) taken back to perch and bashed repeatedly, up to 113 times for a 9-cm Tilapia, before being swallowed head first. Also regularly hovers, before plunging down to take prey in water; in still, calm conditions hovering used for 20% of dives, increasing to 80% in windy conditions. In Malawi, hovering was used for 98% of foraging on sandy beaches where perches rare, but for only 5% on rocky shores where perches common. Hovering allows it to go out over 3 km from shoreline; flies low over water then rises 2–10 m, with body nearly vertical, bill held down and wings beating rapidly; may move or drop down slightly and resume hovering before diving down; if successful, will swallow prey on the wing without prior beating on branch. Feeding success was 55% for dives from a perch and 41% from hovering on L Victoria, but only 18% on L Malawi with no differences between foraging methods. On L Kariba, usual daytime feeding patterns with 4–5 peaks were moved to dawn and dusk to take advantage of sardine (Limnothrissa miodon) rising to surface; in Kashmir, was most active 08:00–09:00 and 16:00–18:00 hours. On land it will take termites on the wing, and will also dive to the ground to catch insects. Seen to hover over a clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), presumably watching for displaced fish. Sometimes uses hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) as a perch."
White Breasted Kingfisher,Carnivore,Halcyon smyrnensis,"Wide variety of prey recorded. Insects  include mole-crickets (Gryllotalpa), crickets and grasshoppers (Locustidae, Tettigidae, Gryllidae), earwigs (Labiduridae, Chelisochidae), cockroaches (Blattodea), bugs (Belostomatidae, Pyrrhocoridae) beetles (Dytiscidae, Dynastidae, Rutilidae, Meloidae, Cicindelidae), mantises (Mantodea), termites (Isoptera), winged ants (Formicidae), moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera); also takes small scorpions (Scorpiones), centipedes (Chilopoda, including dangerous Scolopendra), snails (Achatina), crabs and crustaceans (Palaemonidae, Ocypodidae, Potamonidae, Paratelphusa), earthworms (Megascolecidae), fish  (Cyprinidae, Bagridae, Anabantidae), frogs  and toads (Rana, Bufo), lizards (Gecko, Draco, Calotes, Mabuya), chameleons, snakes (Coluber, Natrix, Ptyas to 65 cm long), birds, voles, mice, and squirrels (Funambulus). In Bengal, fish (31%) composed most of the diet, followed by frogs and toads (19%), insects (16%), reptiles (14%) and crustaceans (11%), but fish component varied from 43% in wet season to 19% in dry season. In a different study in India, analysis revealed that preys was mainly arthropods (83·4%) with many fewer vertebrates; seven orders of insects were identified, with Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera predominant (11). Predation on fish fry in India most concentrated early in morning, 05:45–06:45 hours, and 79% of dives were successful. Birds adults of small passerines (Aegithina tiphia (12), Lonchura, Passer, Zosterops), newly fledged young (Riparia paludicola) (13) and nestlings (Kittacincla malabarica, Passer montanus, Vanellus indicus, Lonchura), and in Israel captures exhausted migrant Willow Warblers (Phylloscopus trochilus); also grabs birds from mist-nets. Typical sit-and-wait predator, spends long periods on perch  8–10 m above ground, with just head bobbing or tail wagging, before diving head first at 45° angle into deep water, or landing feet first in puddle or on ground; can hover for a moment over water before snatching prey. While still on ground or on returning to perch, will batter prey before swallowing it; can take up to 30 minutes before food swallowed. Success sometimes low, just three captures in 22 strikes at one site in Malaysia (1). Termite alates caught on wing, and Scarabaeus beetles taken in flight > 1 hour after dusk; in Kashmir, feeding activity reported as largely crepuscular. Observed turning over earth in an arable field, seeking insects. Closely follows grazing cattle to catch insects disturbed by them. Study of diurnal activities in S India revealed that birds spent a mean 54% of time scanning for prey or danger, 23% feeding, 13% flying, 6% preening and 4% resting (14)."
Storkbilled Kingfisher,Carnivore,Pelargopsis capensis,"Feeds mainly on marine and freshwater fish  , crabs and other crustaceans, but also takes frogs, lizards, rodents, young birds, also insects (Coleoptera) and insect larvae. Perches  quietly on stilt roots in mangroves or on branch overhanging water, typically 2–4 m above the water, watching for prey and occasionally bobbing head or wagging tail; sits vertically, with bill inclined at 40° below horizontal; plunges down at steep angle into water or on to land to capture prey, which is then taken back to the perch and banged against branch a few times to immobilize it, before being swallowed. Recorded following foraging smooth-coated otters (Lutra perspicillata) and taking prey items disturbed by them."
Cattle Egret,Insectivore,Bubulcus ibis,"Broad diet that varies greatly by habitat and season. Mostly grasshoppers, crickets, spiders, flies, frogs, and noctuid moths; fish taken in shallow water during dry seasons (154, 13, 155). Highly adaptable; diversity of food items taken by individuals is related to localized availability of prey and foraging opportunities in any given area."
Common Iora,Insectivore,Aegithina tiphia,"Insects  and other arthropods; rumoured to take small fruits, but this unconfirmed. Recorded preying on a bush frog (2). Prey items range up to size of large mantids; otherwise include spiders (Araneae), ants (Hymenoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), caterpillars and occasional adult lepidopterans. Loners and, commonly, pairs forage  among twigs and foliage at crown level, preferring taller trees, moving often acrobatically to peer beneath leaves; occasionally, birds also dart out to snatch closely passing flying prey. In strongly seasonal environments, non-breeders frequently join mixed-species foraging parties at forest edge; occasionally with other iora species in such parties. Otherwise, groups of more than two individuals foraging together exceptional (and slight evidence from Malaysia that, for rearing purposes, fledged broods are split between parents)."
Red Vented Bulbul,Frugivore,Pycnonotus cafer,"In its native ranges in India and Pakistan, feeds on nectar, fruits, and berries of many plant species. Kumar (58) observed it feeding on sugary exudate produced by sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Johnson (59) noted consumption of petals of southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). Individuals also noted as eating petals from other flowers, including those of Bauhinia variegata, Tecomella undulata and Pisum sativum, and whole flowers of Clitoria ternatea, Clerodendron infortunatum and Tabernaemontana divaricata. In Pakistan, said to feed largely on young buds, green leaves and fallen seeds in winter; in Myanmar, recorded as eating grass seeds. Fruits collected from many trees, shrubs and parasitic plants, including Salvadora, Santalum, Ziziphus, Ficus, mistletoes (Loranthaceae), wild raspberries (Rubus) and Lantana; cultivated crops also exploited. In S India (Point Calimere, in Tamil Nadu), noted to feed on fruits from very broad variety of plants (e.g. Pachygone, Tinospora, Capparis, Flacourtia, Hugonia, Glycosmis, Toddalia, Azadirachta, Walsura, Olax, Cansjera, Pleurostylia, Salacia, Scutia, Ziziphus, Cissus, Allophyllus, Lepisanthes, Lannea, Syzygium, Memecylon, Coccinia, Opuntia, Benkara, Canthium, Ixora, Pavetta, Manilkara, Diospyros, Jasminum, Azima, Salvadora, Carissa, Carmona, Cordia, Ehretia, Solanum, Premna, Breynia, Drypetes, Phyllanthus, Securinegra, Asparagus, Phoenix)."
Red Whiskered Bulbul,Omnivore,Pycnonotus jocosus,"In India, feeds on fruits and berries of figs (Ficus indica) and lantana (Lantana spp.), and nectar of Helicteris isora (55, 16, 56). Visits the flowers of Careya arborea (a tree flowering in dry season in Eastern Ghats) to feed on nectar. In Australia, consumes berries and fruits of lantana, guava, camphor laurel, privet, inkweed, apricot, blackberry (Rubus fructicosa), and nightshade (Solanum spp.; 57, 58, 37, 59). In other parts of its range, also observed to harvest fruit of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae), Muntingia calabura, and arils of Acacia mangium seeds. Collects nectar from Erythrina (Fabaceae) and Spathodea campanulata (Bignoniaceae). Individuals reported also as eating flowers (e.g. of Tabernaemontana divaricata). Takes many arthropods, notably caterpillars, but also grasshoppers (Orthoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), arachnids etc. Young nestlings tend to be fed with soft-bodied insects and larvae, with more drupes and berries as they become a little older."
Indian Robin,Insectivore,Copsychus fulicatus,"Insects (including termites, ants, beetles, flies, caterpillars, grasshoppers, bees and wasps) and their eggs, spiders; marked preference for termites. One record of gecko being struck from wall, battered and eaten, and one (same area) of small frog being caught, battered (8 minutes) and fed to young; probably same bird involved. Recorded feeding on a carcass  . Forages largely on ground, darting about with agile hopping gait and moving from spot to spot in short jerky flight, occasionally entering clumps of herbs or thorn bush, sometimes flipping over small stones and leaves with bill; very little aerial sallying. When feeding young, foraging behaviour includes use of wings and tail in attempts to flush insects."
Turtle Dove,Grainivore,Streptopelia orientalis,"Raids paddyfields, and also feeds  on cereals and pine seeds; also herbs, bamboo shoots and green shoots of various plants. In former USSR, observed plucking berries from Prunus trees; indeed opportunistic frugivory is widely reported (7). Takes sunflower seeds in sunflower fields in Japan (8). Recorded also feeding on small snails  . Most feeding  is on the ground. "
White Wagtail,Insectivore,Motacilla alba,"Stomachs of wintering birds in the pre-Saharan steppe of Tunisia contained mostly beetles, followed by caterpillars, ants, tenebrionid beetles, and weevils (Coleoptera); also contained 1–5 stones. One stomach had many leaf fragments (Heatwole and Muir 1982). M. a. lugens (""Black-backed"" Wagtail) in southern Ussuriland consumed small Diptera during spring and summer, and consumed large caddisfly larvae, mayflies, amphipods (Gammarus), and water scorpions (Nepidae) during fall migration (Panov 1973). On Kuril Islands, in 12 stomachs: Diptera (adults and pupae); Aphrophoridae; earwigs (Dermaptera); beetles (Coleoptera) including Elateridae, Chrysomelidae, Staphylinidae, and small Melolonthinae; bugs (Hemiptera); Sipha subrugosa; hill ants (Formica rufa); Ichneomonidae; caterpillars (Lepidoptera); spiders (Araneae); small seeds; and sand particles (Nechaev 1969).  Also known to eat dragonflies (Odonata), termites (Isoptera), small snails (Mollusca), crustaceans, and worms (Annelida), as well as fish fry; crumbs and other household scraps also taken. Observed to take fly maggots from carcasses."
White Rumped Vulture,Carnivore,Gyps bengalensis,"Exclusively carrion, especially remains of cattle  . Regularly feeds in company of other vultures  , especially G. indicus, and also other scavengers, e.g. jackals, corvids and dogs. Carrion located by means of keen eyesight; soaring vultures also watch other flying vultures and other scavengers; when one drops to carcass, all birds in sight follow suit, and many can gather in short time. As with other vulture species, the birds tend to gorge themselves, then rest for long period nearby, on ground or tree, while food is digested."
Crested Serpent Eagle,Carnivore,Spilornis cheela,"Feeds mainly on reptiles, especially tree snakes  ; less commonly on mammals, crabs, eels, frogs and birds. Recent study in India documented 173 prey items: 74% reptiles, 18% birds, 7% amphibians and 0·5% each fishes and mammals 12. Another study in India recorded predation on termites 13, and in Peninsular Malaysia has been observed hunting large earthworms 14. Hunts almost exclusively from exposed perch near open glade or along stream or forest edge; when foraging remains still for long periods while scanning for suitable prey items. Prey taken on ground  or from trees, after short stoop, and consumed on ground or on elevated perch  ."
Purple Moorhen,Carnivore,Porphyrio porphyrio,"Omnivorous, but primarily vegetarian, taking shoots, leaves, roots, stems, flowers and seeds of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. Principal food items include Typha (especially leaf bases and pith), Scirpus (pith from stems), young rice plants, seeds of grasses, sedges, Rumex, Polygonum, etc., and vegetative parts (especially tubers) of water-lilies. Animal foods normally small proportion of diet, including molluscs, leeches, small crabs, insects and their larvae, spiders, fish and their eggs, frogs and their eggs, lizards, snakes, birds, their eggs and nestlings, small rodents, and carrion. Forages in cover, at edge of cover on muddy, sandy or hard shoreline, in shallow water and on floating vegetation. Swims relatively little, but will dabble near shallow margins like Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) or pick insects from water surface. Also recorded feeding on insects taken from spiders webs  . Climbs freely to strip flowers and seeds from reeds, etc., and to take bird eggs and nestlings. Uses bill to cut, dig up or pull out plants, to move stones and gravel, to turn over matted vegetation, and to dismember food items, and foot to grasp and manipulate food. Adaptable: will forage in pasture, scrub and mown fields; grazes clover and grass; also feeds in rice fields. Builds platforms for feeding and roosting. Feeds mainly in early morning and late evening; sometimes at night."
Painted Francolin,Grainivore,Francolinus pictus,"Seeds of grasses, weeds and cereals, and fresh grass and cereal shoots, berries and drupes, such as Zizyphus; also termites and other insects and their larvae and eggs. Usually observed in pairs or small family parties."
Spotted Dove,Grainivore,Streptopelia chinensis,"Seeds and berries dominate the diet. Berries of ukiuki (Dianella sandwicense) are important in Hawaiian Is. (Richardson and Bowles 1964), as are those of passionflower (including banana poka [Passiflora mollissima]; Scott et al. 1986). Other common food items in Hawaiian Is. include seeds, fruits, or berries of pöpolo (Solanum spp.), 'äkia (Wikstroemia spp.), 'uhaloa (Waltheria indica), 'ilima (Sida spp.), lantana (Lantana camara), balsam pear (Momordica charantia), corn sorghum (Sorghum spp.), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan; Schwartz and Schwartz Schwartz and Schwartz 1949, Schwartz and Schwartz 1951a; current plant names from Wagner et al. 1990); large seeds preferred, representing both native and exotic plant species. Routinely takes commercial bird seed at feeders in Hawaiian Is. and s. California. Few data on diet away from feeders in s. California. In its native range, known to feed on Ficus platypoda (Lepschi 1997) and the berries of Berberis ceratophylla. Sometimes takes insects, e.g. winged termites (Sivakumaran and Rahmani 2005)."
Long Tailed Shrike,Carnivore,Lanius schach,"Very opportunistic. Wide variety of insects, with preference mostly for larger species  and groups, e.g. grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera); also, regularly takes vertebrates such as small mammals, lizards  , frogs, crabs and small birds  , including nestlings up to size of Laughing Dove (Spilopelia senegalensis). Comparatively bold and fearless. Hunts from prominent perch  ; takes most of its prey  on ground, but also hawks insects in air; hops on ground. Occasionally steals food from other birds. Impales some of its victims."
Jungle Babler,Insectivore,Turdoides striata,"Wide range of invertebrates, mainly insects, including hymenopterans (ants, wasps, ichneumon flies), beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), cockroaches (Blattodea), caterpillars, moths (Lepidoptera), mantises (Mantodea), stick-insects (Phasmida), bugs (Hemiptera), also spiders (Araneae); also frogs; also grain, seeds, figs (Ficus), berries (including those of Lantana and Ziziphus), and nectar of Salmalia, Butea, Erythrina and Helicteres isora. In one study, plant matter accounted for 56% of diet by weight, involving pulp of fruit, pearl millet, wheat and leafy material; remaining food was lepidopterans (18%), hymenopterans (6%), orthopterans (6%), beetles (4%), snails and spiders (less then 1%), with remaining 10% unidentified. In another study, 22% of total food by volume was insects (mostly beetles), 74% bajra grain (Pennisetum typhoides), 4% other vegetable material. Very gregarious, in parties of 6–12 individuals throughout year; large flocks break up into smaller groups during breeding season. Often forms nucleus of mixed-species foraging parties. Occasionally associates with T. affinis. Spends much time on ground  ."
Brown Headed Barbet,Frugivore,Psilopogon zeylanicus,"Feeds on fruits  , especially figs  , Syzygium fruits, and berries, including those of coffee, and also tomatoes and garden fruits; takes flower petals and nectar of Bombax, Erythrina and Butea; also takes animal food including beetles, mantids, ants, termites, and various large and small lizards. In one study in WC India, present species appeared to prefer much larger fig species (Ficus bengalensis, F. mysorensis) than did P. haemacephalus. May gather with other barbets and frugivorous birds. Often bathes."
House Crow,Omnivore,Corvus splendens,"Omnivorous scavenger, feeding on all manner of crops, invertebrates  , vertebrates  . Main diet composed of discards and scraps foraged from rubbish dumps, abattoirs and street debris, also street markets and in fishing villages. Eats  almost anything, from all kinds of places, ranging from foraging in flowering trees (for nectar) to scavenging for offal; feeds on carrion  of all kinds, from dead fish to human corpses on tideline or riverside. Will take fish and insects from water, almost plunge-diving to do so, and undertakes ungainly aerial sallies to take flying ants (Formicidae). Takes eggs and nestlings of many bird species, including larger ones such as herons and egrets (Ardeidae), where it can cause havoc in nesting colonies; likewise with colonies of weavers (Ploceidae), where this crow's agility allows it to gain access to nest-chambers. Attracted to livestock, feeding among feet of cattle, where it steals food items from attendant Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis); also rides on backs and necks of large mammals, not only taking ticks (Ixodoidea) and other parasites, but also pecking at open sores. Kills small rodents  , and reports of attacks even on human babies, monkeys and cats; kills newborn domestic animals. Does great damage to crops, pulling up seedlings by roots and taking grain and rice from stores. Enters houses to scavenge food. Bold and aggressive by nature, with sociable scavenging habits, but also very wary of humans, in Egypt feeding mostly very early in mornings, spending most of the day at rest, hidden in tree or palm foliage (thus avoiding close contact with man); in most of range, however, displays little fear of man. Always alert, and constantly wary, nervously wing-flicking as it walks or hops on ground. Forms massive roosts  , gathering on rooftops in noisy parties prior to flying off towards main roost, where hundreds or thousands may converge, together with large numbers of parakeets (Psittacidae) and mynas (Sturnidae) in plantations or mangroves; just before dawn, flies back to favoured foraging grounds."
Quaker Babler,Omnivore,Alcippe poioicephala,"Ants and other insects; also nectar, particularly of Erythrina. Usually found in parties of 6–10 individuals, sometimes up to 20 or more. Forages in middle storey and undergrowth but also ascends to canopy; often 9 m above ground. Often forms nucleus of mixed-species feeding flocks."
Purple Sunbird,Omnivore,Cinnyris asiaticus,"Small insects  , and spiders (Araneae); nectar  , also fruits, particularly of mistletoes (Loranthaceae) but also grapes. Forages singly, in pairs and in small to medium-sized groups; larger groups (up to 200 individuals) observed in non-breeding season. Visits flowers of aloes (Aloe), Avicenna marina, Calotropis procera, Lycium, Prosopis cineracea, Prosopis juliflora and Maerua crassifolia."
Green Bee Eater,Insectivore,Merops orientalis,"Feeds mainly on Hymenoptera  , also beetles, termites, bugs, moths and many flies, ranging in size from fruit-flies (Drosophila) to large clegs; also a few butterflies, crickets, dragonflies, spiders and caterpillars. In Chad, Hymenoptera (of 50 species) comprise 75% of diet, including many ants, as well as small halictine bees, ichneumon flies, chalcidid, scolioid, vespid, pompilid and sphecid wasps and some honeybees (Apis mellifera), but also beetles (17%), termites, assassin-, squash- and shield-bugs, micro-Lepidoptera, fruit-flies, clegs and robber-flies (cumulatively 8%) (1). Hunts from perch on fence, small thorny tree  or sometimes the back of antelope, making sallies low over vegetation."
Pallid Harrier,Carnivore,Circus macrourus,"Small mammals  and birds  and, especially in winter quarters, large insects. Takes advantage of demographic explosions of rodents  , feeding on voles, mice, gerbils, steppe lemmings (Lagurus lagurus) and ground-squirrels; birds, particularly small terrestrial passerines e.g. larks and pipits, and also partridge chicks, can be of greater importance in diet. Insects include grasshoppers and locusts, and to lesser degree beetles, crickets, dragonflies and others. Reptiles and frogs taken less often, although lizards (Lacerta) common in areas of sand dunes in Pakistan. Flies low  , 1–5 m above ground, into wind, dropping on to small prey spotted on ground; spends large part of day in hunting. Captures insects fleeing from grass fires. In study of wintering individuals in N Cameroon, four strategies were employed to capture birds, i.e. fast contour flight, open approach with rapid acceleration, covert ambush, and stoop from flight; success of 149 capture attempts (by 47 harriers) was 18·8%, but differed with strategy used, the ambush and open-approach strategies being more successful than fast contour flight; most commonly targeted and captured bird species was Red-billed Quelea (Quelea quelea ) (11)."
Grey Jungle Fowl,Omnivore,Gallus sonneratii,"Diverse diet, including seeds of bamboo and Strobilanthes among others, shoots of grass and crops, tubers, figs and berries of Zizyphus (Rhamnaceae), Lantana, Streblus (Moraceae), etc. Animals eaten include insects (e.g. grasshoppers and termites) and even small reptiles. In Tamil Nadu, diet constituted 55%, 31·1% and 13·9% of plant matter, animal matter and grit, respectively, based on analysis of droppings (4). Often pecks at dung of cattle, elephants, etc. (1). Appears to forage close to cover and in same area during successive days, presumably responding to local distribution of food supplies; sometimes recorded in groups  of 5–6 birds, but large numbers congregate where food is seasonally abundant, e.g. seeding bamboo (1)."
Indian Blackbird,Omnivore,Turdus simillimus,"Invertebrates and fruits of forest. Forages  on ground  , where seen to peck at dung beside forest track; also feeds in fruiting and flowering  trees."
Shikra,Carnivore,Accipiter badius,"Mainly lizards  , geckos, skinks (2) and small birds (9–22 g) up to size of exotic Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) (10), bee-eaters  (Merops), rollers (Coracias/Eurystomus), even small gamebirds (2) and African Palm Swifts (Cypsiurus parvus) as they leave their nests (18); also nestlings (e.g. sparrow chicks from roof (2) ), eggs, gerbils (19), bats, rodents (e.g. Microtus voles (20) and Meriones gerbils) (19), frogs and insects (beetles, termites and Orthopterans (2) ), rarely carrion, and seen chasing domestic chickens (14). Hunts mainly from a perch  within vegetation, making a short dash to take prey on a trunk  , in foliage or on ground, occasionally even briefly entering buildings (2). Rarely makes aerial pursuits, preferring to use cover to make short surprise attacks (2), but generally forceful in attacks on prey. Changes perch with low flap and glide flight."
Grey Breasted Prinia,Insectivore,Prinia hodgsonii,"Food basically insects, including small beetles (Coleoptera), small moths and caterpillars (Lepidoptera) and grasshoppers (Orthoptera). Said to take nectar of various trees and shrubs (including Butea, Erythrina, Bombax and Woodfordia), as birds often have pollen-stained face, but this perhaps more likely acquired when searching flowers for insects. In non-breeding season usually in parties of 5–10 individuals, sometimes as many as 20, but in breeding season invariably found in ones and twos. Very active, working twigs and leaves both in low undergrowth and quite high up; flits between bushes, moving quickly through shrubbery. Often forages with mixed parties of small birds, such as various small babblers (Timaliidae)."
Ashy Wren Warbler,Insectivore,Prinia socialis,"Small invertebrates, chiefly insects and their larvae, and small spiders (Araneae); believed also to take flower nectar from Bombax and Erythrina and other shrubs, but pollen staining of head perhaps acquired when searching flowers for insects. Usually singly or in pairs. Although not shy, is generally unobtrusive, keeping low in vegetation. Forages close to ground  , climbing up stalks or inside bushes, gleaning insects from both leaves and ground. Flies weakly, keeping low, for a few metres before diving back into cover."
Roseringed Parakeet,Frugivore,Psittacula krameri,"In Africa, recorded fruits  include Ficus, Ziziphus, Tamarindus, guavas, dates, mangoes, baobab, seeds of Acacia albida and Slassus, plus cultivated seeds and nuts of millet, sorghum, lentils, guinea-corn, groundnuts, oil-palms, coffee. In Asia, specific items identified include seeds of Prosopis spicigera, Acacia arabica, Casuarina equisetifolia, fruit of Dalbergia sissoo, Ficus, Acacia, Ziziphus, Xanthium, Melia azedarach, Azadirachta indica and Albizia lebbek, flowers and fruit of Capparis aphylla, flower petals and nectar of Salmalia malabarica, Erythrina indica, Butea monosperma, Bassia latifolia. In Asia, especially India  , regarded as one of the most destructive bird pests in agriculture  , coming in enormous flocks to cereals and fruit crops, especially Citrus and Prunus; however, in one area, guavas (Psidium guajava) were the favoured cultivated fruit, with maize eaten Sept–Dec, groundnuts Nov–Mar and May–Jun, and wheat Mar; in another, pearl millet, sorghum and maize were greatly consumed Aug–Dec, guava Jan–Mar and Jul–Aug, mulberry (Morus alba) seeds Apr–May. Coffee, chillie, sunflowers, mustard, pepper and gram also attacked; will tear open sacks. Feral birds in UK take fruits and berries of Rosaceae, Ilex, Sambucus, nuts of Fagus, Aesculus, Carpinus, Fraxinus, Pinus, cultivated fruit and cereals, food at bird-tables; feral birds in Arabia take dates, grain, seeds of sunflower and Caesalpina."
Pale Billed Flowepecker,Frugivore,Dicaeum erythrorhynchos,"Mainly fruits  of mistletoes; also nectar, spiders (Araneae) and small insects. Forages mostly in canopy. Forages singly and in pairs; also in groups in non-breeding season. May join mixed-species feeding flocks in Sri Lanka."
Pied Bushchat,Insectivore,Saxicola caprata,"Small insects  and their larvae, including beetles, caterpillars, moths, midges and ants, also earthworms; once seen with berry in bill. Small caterpillars seen brought to nestlings. Forages in typical stonechat fashion, flying from perch (e.g. tall grass or top of low bush) to ground to take prey; occasionally sallying in air, in New Guinea this apparently commonest method, at least in late afternoon when flying insects numerous. Once seen to take worms and other invertebrates in wake of rootling domestic pig. Female vagrant held territory 0·07 ha (35 × 20 m)."
Laughing Dove,Grainivore,Streptopelia senegalensis,"Seeds less than 2 mm in length comprise most of diet, but species also takes entire sunflower seeds or grains of maize; also eats fruits and nectar from Aloe; some insects are taken including ants, termites, fly larvae and pupae. Monocotyledons comprise 70–80% of diet in years of good rainfall. Seed items identified include those of oats, wheat, millet, sorghum, Croton, Celosia, Amaranthus, Oxalis, Rhus, Polygala, Acacia and various legumes. Food is taken on the ground  , the birds foraging close to shrubs; rarely plucks fruit or grain directly from plants. Generally solitary  or in pairs or in flocks of 3–4, but hundreds may gather near water."
Grey Wagtail,Insectivore,Motacilla cinerea,"Prey mainly insects, notably fly larvae and adults (Diptera, especially Chironomidae) and nymphal and adult mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera); some dragonflies (Odonata), moth caterpillars and adult butterflies (Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), lacewings and alderflies (Neuroptera), bugs (Hemiptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera); freshwater shrimps (Gammarus), terrestrial snails (Mollusca) and spiders (Araneae) also eaten. In India, three stomachs contained 28 flies, 10 bugs, 7 grasshoppers, 6 beetles, 3 dragonflies and a spider. Of 944 prey items retrieved from nestlings in Czech Republic, 90% comprised flies, mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and beetles in equal proportions, while caddis flies and homopteran bugs each comprised just over 3%, and other items included insects (Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, Neuroptera), spiders, crustaceans and gastropod snails; almost 69% of food items were adult insects, but prey taken to nestlings varied according to weather. In a second study in Czech Republic, flies comprised 36% of 496 prey items, stoneflies 26%, homopterans 13·5% and caddis flies 8·5%; aquatic insect larvae represented less than 7% of nestling diet, although they were more important earlier in breeding season when there were more large larvae in the river (as the season progresses, the adults emerge). In C Asia, nestlings at L Baikal were fed a range of insect prey, as well as spiders and terrestrial molluscs, but 54% of items were, in order of abundance, mayflies, stoneflies, flies and caddis flies; in Tien Shan Mts mayflies, stoneflies and caddis flies dominated the nestling diet in late Jun and early Jul, accounting for 85% of food items, but comprised only 5·4% in late Jul, when dipterans (32·8%) were most important. Forages  by walking and picking  , run-picking, and flying up a short distance from ground to catch an insect; also makes flycatching sallies  from a perch out over water, this technique being more frequent in summer months when temperatures are high and aerial insects more active. Also wades in shallow water to pick aquatic prey."
Yellow Wagtail,Insectivore,Motacilla flava,"Diet includes wide variety of terrestrial  and aquatic invertebrates  ; also some plant material, especially seeds. Invertebrates range from small flies  (Diptera), bugs (Hemiptera), beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), butterflies (Lepidoptera), cockroaches (Blattodea), termites (Isoptera) and ants (Hymenoptera) to crustaceans; dragonflies  (Odonata) sometimes important by mass. In African winter quarters, sample of stomach contents dominated in terms of bulk by adult beetles 3–5 mm long, and larvae of beetles and lepidopterans present in small numbers; bugs, beetles, ants and grasshoppers were numerically the most important prey in another study. Small flies were found to be most important elsewhere, as at L Chad and L Victoria. Some berries, e.g. from saltbush (Salvadora persica), and other plant material also taken. Forages  by picking items from the ground  or from water while walking; also run-picks, and makes short flights to catch insects in the air, over water or from vegetation. Occasionally hovers over vegetation to take prey. Frequently associates with domestic stock, especially cattle, both in summer and in winter, also with wild game in winter quarters; takes advantage of insects attracted by the animals and their dung and disturbed by their grazing activity. Often in small to large or very large flocks outside breeding season; single individuals often defend a feeding territory throughout winter, and small flocks may also do so."
Red Wattled Lapwing,Insectivore,Vanellus indicus,"Beetles and other insects, including ants, butterfly and fly larvae, grasshoppers, crickets, bugs, earwigs and termites; also molluscs, worms and crustaceans. One record of the species predating the eggs of Charadrius alexandrinus in Arabia (7). Feeds  mostly at dawn and dusk, and during moonlit night."
White Cheeked Barbet,Frugivore,Psilopogon viridis,"Banyan, pipal, other figs and fruits and berries, including those under cultivation (e.g. coffee) (1); sips nectar; animal food, especially insects and their larvae (4) (including butterflies, dragonflies, mantids, cicadas, beetles and winged termites) and mainly during breeding season (4), as well as earthworms and spiders; also flowers (Cullenia exarillata, Clitoria ternatea recorded) (5). In one study in S India, present species preferred much larger fig species (Ficus mysorensis, F. insignis) than did P. malabaricus, but with seasonal shifts in consumption, preferentially taking fruit of Bischofia javanica, Leea indica, Lantana camara and Solanum indicum in Jan–Feb, Ficus retusa and F. tsiela in Mar, switching to Actinodaphne hookeri in Apr along with Machilus macrantha, then Grewia tiliaefolia, F. retusa, F. tsiela, Macaranga, Lantana, Solanum and on nectar of Erythrina and, rarely, Spathodea campanulata in May–Aug, while by year-end preference switches to figs of F. insignis and F. infectoria, as well as fruits of Solanum, Lantana and Leea indica, and nectar of Bombax ceiba and Erythrina (4); c. 30% of its dietary items consisted of animal food. When feeding on figs, commonly swallows the fruit whole. Takes insects and larvae in foliage and along branches and trunks; hawks (clumsily) (1) for moths and winged termites; sometimes lands on ground, especially when following mixed-species flocks (4) but also to bathe (1), although most foraging is in the canopy and subcanopy (6). Sometimes gathers in parties of up to c. 20 to feed on fruits, even c. 30 at winged termite hatchings (4). Aggressive at fruiting trees, and in mixed feeding flocks, and also around nest; however, reportedly does not chase Western Koels (Eudynamys scolopaceus) (4). Feeds  mainly in early to mid morning and from mid to late afternoon (4)."
Indian Scimitar Babler,Omnivore,Pomatorhinus horsfieldii,"Insects, grubs, spiders (Araneae); also berries and flower nectar. Found in pairs during breeding season, otherwise in small parties of 4–10 individuals; often in association with mixed feeding parties. Forages on ground under dense undergrowth, flicking aside or turning over leaves or digging vigorously in mulch. Also hops along moss-covered branches or up trunks of trees."
Blyth's Reed Warbler,Insectivore,Acrocephalus dumetorum,"Diet includes following items: mayflies (Ephemeroptera), dragonflies (Odonata: Agriidae), stoneflies (Plecoptera), orthopterans, larval earwigs (Dermaptera), bugs (Hemiptera), lacewings (of family Chrysopidae), adult and larval lepidopterans, caddis flies (Trichoptera), dipteran flies (including tipulids), hymenopterans (including sawflies, ants, bees and wasps), adult and larval beetles (Coleoptera); spiders (Araneae), harvestmen (Opiliones), snails; some seeds also taken. Forages  usually on side or top foliage of trees  and bushes, as well as in herb layer. Hops on the ground, and catches insects in flight."
Scarlet Minivet,Insectivore,Pericrocotus speciosus,"Eats mainly insects  , including caterpillars (Lepidoptera), grasshoppers and green crickets (Orthoptera) and cicadas (Cicadidae); also spiders (Arachnida). Gregarious; regularly joins mixed-species foraging flocks. Forages in canopy or in crowns of emergent trees; visits crops of ripe figs (Ficus), apparently for insects attracted by the fruit. Prey taken mainly in canopy foliage; also sallies after flushed prey, and hovers in front of flowers."
Malabar Crested lark,NA,Galerida malabarica,"Diet poorly known; apparently seeds and invertebrates, e.g. orthopterans, beetles (Coleoptera), ants (Formicidae). Forages on ground  , singly or in pairs; also in flocks of up to c. 30 individuals in non-breeding season."
Common Kingfisher,Carnivore,Alcedo atthis,"Fish  the main prey in Europe: include minnows (Phoxinus), sticklebacks (Gasterosteus), bullhead (Cottus), roach (Rutilis), barbel (Barbus), grayling (Thymallus), trout (Salmo), dace and chub (Leuciscus), perch (Perca), young pike (Esox), loach (Cobitis, Noemacheilus), carp (Carassius), gudgeon (Gobio), ruffe (Acerina), bleak (Alburnus), nase (Chondrostoma), and many other species up to 125 mm long. Also takes aquatic insects, including water-bugs (Hemiptera), water beetles (Dytiscidae), dragonfly nymphs  and occasionally adults (Odonata), mayflies (Ephemeroptera), lacewings (Neuroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera), caddis flies (Trichoptera); also flies (Diptera), butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), amphibians  (Rana), crayfish (Astacus), prawns (Palaemon), shrimps (Gammarus) and isopods in winter. Very occasionally feeds on berries (Rubus, Sambucus) and stems of reed (Phragmites). In Britain and Ireland diet consisted of 60% fish, 20% insects and larvae, 5% crustacea, 5% tadpoles, and 5% molluscs; in Belgium, bullhead and loaches formed 96% of remains in pellets; elsewhere in Europe more variable diet, e.g. in Spain 78% fish, 10% crustaceans, 8% insects, 3% frogs. Wintering birds in Malaysia fed mainly on fish (60%) and shrimps  (30%), with median prey length of 30 mm. Found to consume 50–60% of its body mass daily, requiring 38 successful dives; one bird ate 13–21 minnows daily, a total of 46 g. Perches  for long periods, usually 1–2 m above the water  , occasionally to 11 m, periodically turning around and bobbing head and body to gauge distance when food sighted; dives steeply  and catches prey below water to maximum depth of 1 m; using its buoyancy and flapping the wings, it rises through water bill first and flies back to its perch, where the fish is held near the tail  , beaten against perch several times, then positioned lengthways in bill and swallowed head first  ; larger prey given longer and more thorough beating, held by tail and head battered against perch. Prey sometimes become impaled on thorns or wire during beating and may be left. Sometimes takes prey from water surface, and where no perches avai-lable will hover before diving. Seen to follow a foraging smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) to feed on fish and other displaced aquatic animals. Insects taken in flight. In Nepal, dives from perch for fish were 38% successful, but 54% successful from hovering. In Malaysia, 90% of foraging was diving from perch, 2·6% from hovering, 0·9% from horizontal flight, and overall success rate was 53%. In Kashmir, most feeding activity during 10:00–12:00 hours and 17:00–19:00 hours, avoiding peak feeding times of Ceryle rudis and Halcyon smyrnensis, but in Malaysia no well-defined activity patterns. Several times each day regurgitates a small pellet of indigestible fish bones and insect parts."
Koel,Omnivore,Eudynamys scolopaceus,"Fruits of figs (Ficus), mulberries (Morus), jujubes (Zizyphus), Brazilian cherry (Eugenia uniflora), wild cherry (Prunus pseudocerasus), tamarind (Tamarindus indica), java olive tree (Sterculia foetida), large-flowered bay tree (Persea macrantha), sandalwood (Santalum), Pithecellobium dulce, guava (Psidium guajava), nuts of various palms including Chinese fan palm (Livistoma chinensis), oil palm and (Archontophoenix alexandrae), poisonous fruit of Yellow Oleander (Thevatia neriifolia), nectar of Indian coral tree (Erythrina indica), nectar and flower of bluebellvine (Clitoria ternatea), fruit and nectar of papaya (Carica papaya)."
